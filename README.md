First Repository and use of GitHub. This will be my Final Project for Data Structures


The Perfect Bar Crawl.


  ~ Description:
  
In this project I'm going to allow users to input information about the location of different pubs and bars, and create an ideal bar crawl between bars. 

  ~ Plan of Attack:

I'm going to construct a series of weighted graphs, and will have functions that allows the user, after constructing the graph via inputs, to establish a starting location then choose their nights priority. This could include an intended destination and/or desires for the night, like good dancing, good food, low prices, etc.

  ~ Intended output:
  
The program will use algorithms to find and output the best path for the night.

  ~ Use:
  
The user will first enter bars names, and their position in a 10 by 10 city, then for each bar they will decide which bars are adjacent (without redundancy). After this, each user will be able to print a map of the city, to see where bars are located, or, more precisely, which spots in the city have a bar. They will be able to find the shortest path between bars while avoiding the police, and the easiest way to travel between bars.
