# Wright_CSCI2270_FinalProject
First Repository and use of GitHub. This will be my Final Project for Data Structures


The Perfect Bar Crawl.


  ~ Description:
  
In this project I'm going to allow users to input information about different pubs and bars. The user will be able to associate each bar with score quantifying relative elevation, average line size, food quality, drink quality, average prices, relative locations, etc.

  ~ Plan of Attack:

I'm going to construct a series of weighted graphs, and will have functions that allows the user, after constructing the graph via inputs, to establish a starting location then choose their nights priority. This could include an intended destination and/or desires for the night, like good dancing, good food, low prices, etc.

  ~ Intended output:
  
The program will use algorithms to find and output the best path for the night.
